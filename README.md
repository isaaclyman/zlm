# ZLM - Zero Language Model

A chatbot that isn't trained on stolen contentâ€”or, indeed, any content at all.

Scripts:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm build
```

## Contributing

Most of ZLM's logic is in `getTextResponse.ts`.

PR's will only be accepted if they make the chatbot more annoying.
